# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## 📌 Features
- Uses `RandomForestClassifier` for fraud detection.
- Handles data preprocessing (scaling, train-test split).
- Evaluates performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualizes results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`creditcard.csv`) contains transaction details, with a `Class` column indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
